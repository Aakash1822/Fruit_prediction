# Fruit_prediction

This is basically some simple steps of prediction of types of fruits by its given attributes using unsupervised learning algorithm.
First we take datasets of fruits and using pandas we make some categorical data in into further insightful information including frequency, mean, median, count etc.
After that using seaborn modules we pictorised data into bar graph form and check the fruits counts according to types.
Then split data into train and test set and make a model and apply ml algorithms on it
